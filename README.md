# blackhole-FE

Build Week Project

Deployed at: https://blackhole-reactapp.netlify.com/


Pitch: Sometimes, you just need to vent to get it out, move on, and feel better.  Enter black hole. The reverse note taking app where everything you type automatically gets dumped in the trash. Research shows writing things down helps your brain move past the thought and onto bigger and brighter things. Don’t let the fear of other people reading what you write stop you from reaping these benefits! Driver cut you off? Frustrated with the hour long wait time at a restaurant? Type out your response, hit submit, and it’s absorbed into the black hole so you can move on with your life.

MVP:
User will be able to create, read, update, and delete a venting entry. When the user clicks the submit button the entry will be deleted. The user will be able to store their message for an x number of days(set by user) if they wish in their storage area.


Stretch: add some animation so the user can watch their vent session be crumpled and thrown away or sucked into a back hole.

Upcoming Features: Allow users to choose different animations for their messages to be sucked into the blackhole and allow the user to change between different blackholes and color themes.
